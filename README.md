## Instructions

1. Upload your own `AX6-LEDE.config` file (depending on which branch you want to be on)
2. Enter the Actions page to manually start the compilation
3. When the compilation is complete, download the compiled `xxx-factory.ubi` firmware on the Releases page.
4. If you have previously flashed dual systems to AX6, please enter `fw_setenv flag_last_success=1` and `fw_setenv flag_boot_rootfs=1` and then restart the device to switch the system (if not, please click the [reference link(Please solve the translation problem yourself)](https://www.right.com.cn/forum/thread-6054985-1-1.html) to install the dual system)

6. Flashing in the firmware `ubiformat /dev/mtd13 -y -f /tmp/openwrt-xxx-redmi_ax6-squashfs-nand-factory.ubi` PS: The file name is just an example. When flashing in, the ubi file name you downloaded will prevail

## Issues
#### Disclaimer: The following known issues are all personal measurements, and there may be unknown issues. I am not responsible for any issues caused by the firmware

~~* As of the editing of this article, since the memory leak problem of ax6's openwrt is still unresolved, my personal suggestion is to restart every once in a while and add the following commands through the system-startup item-local startup script (note: to exit Before 0):~~
   ```bash
   echo "0 4 * * * sleep 5 && touch /etc/banner && reboot" >> /etc/crontabs/root
   echo "0 16 * * * sleep 5 && touch /etc/banner && reboot" >> /etc/crontabs/root
   ```
   ~~Then restart the router once. It will restart at 4 am and 16 pm every day. If you can understand the principle of crontab, you can also customize the restart time.~~

* (update)The problem of luci stuck due to memory seems to be fixed (I haven't seen luci crash for several days after booting), but due to at least 5.15 kernel, it can't open 160Mhz.
